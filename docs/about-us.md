title: About us
---

[Lacodix](https://www.lacodix.de) is a webdesign agency based in Rastatt, Germany.

Laravel, PHP, Tailwind, Livewire are some examples of free pieces of software we use in our projects.
All of this software is open source and free to use and we are very appreciative of that.
If we found a solution that might help other developers, we try to create a package and release it
as open source on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/lacodix) 

Special thanks to [Freek Van der Herten from spatie.be](https://spatie.be/) who gave hints and ideas
to create this documentation. This package is also based on Spaties 
[laravel package skeleton](https://github.com/spatie/package-skeleton-laravel)
